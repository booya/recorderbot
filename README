recorderbot v0.1

recorderbot is a script for creating incrementally numbered audio files.  It continually
monitors the default audio input device until it detects non-silence, and will record
everything until silence is detected again.  If the file is too short it will be discarded; 
otherwise it will be kept, the ID number is incremented.  It will do this forever until
STOPFILE is created, or there is a power outage, etc.

The default settings are suitable for recording DJ sets, however other uses are possible
by tweaking the silence parameters.
